   Before we really get started, we will need a /Cumulocity/ account. Go to [[https://cumulocity.com/]], you can apply for a free trial account by click the "TRY CUMULOCITY FREE" button on the top-right corner. After signing-up and login to your tenant, you would find the device registration page in /Device Management/. Next, we will demonstrate how to register a device to /Cumulocity/ using the library.

   Without any further ado, let's write our first program, the customary /hello world/ [fn:4] example shown in Listing [[lst:01-hello]].

   #+CAPTION: Hello Cumulocity
   #+NAME: lst:01-hello
   #+BEGIN_SRC C++ :tangle ../examples/ex-01-hello/main.cc :exports code -r
     // ex-01-hello: src/main.cc
     #include <iostream>
     #include <sragent.h>
     #include <srlogger.h>
     using namespace std;

     int main()
     {
             const char *server = "http://developer.cumulocity.com";
             const char *credentialPath = "/tmp/helloc8y";
             const char *deviceID = "13344568";   // unique device identifier
             srLogSetLevel(SRLOG_DEBUG);          // set log level to debug
             SrAgent agent(server, deviceID);     // instantiate SrAgent
             if (agent.bootstrap(credentialPath)) // bootstrap to Cumulocity
                     return 0;
             cerr << "Hello, Cumulocity!" << endl;
             return 0;
     }
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_NOTE
   It's strongly encouraged that you pick a different random value for ~deviceID~, as it's the unique identifier of your device.
   #+END_NOTE

   For convenience, let's define a shell variable ~C8Y_LIB_PATH~ to hold the library root path and use it to feed the compiler so it can find all necessary =C++= header files and shared library ~.so~ file.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $ export C8Y_LIB_PATH=/library/root/path
     $ g++ -std=c++11 -I$C8Y_LIB_PATH/include -L$C8Y_LIB_PATH/lib -lsera main.cc
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_NOTE
   You can define the variable ~C8Y_LIB_PATH~ in your ~.bashrc~ file so you don't need to define it every time when launching a new terminal. From now on, I'd assume you have done so and will mention no more about ~C8Y_LIB_PATH~ in later examples.
   #+END_NOTE

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$C8Y_LIB_PATH/lib ./a.out
     ...
     Hello, Cumulocity!
   #+END_SRC

   Finally, it's time to run our first program. Type the ~deviceID~ into the text field in your registration page (Fig [[fig:register]]) and click /Register device/. After the program is running, a green /Accept/ button shall show up, click it to accept your device into your tenant.

   As illustrated, the program will print /Hello, Cumulocity!/ then exit. Voila, that's all we need to register a device to /Cumulocity/.

   The obtained device credential is stored in =/tmp/helloc8y= as defined in variable ~credentialPath~. You can also find the credential in the /Device credential/ page in your /Cumulocity/ portal.

   #+BEGIN_NOTE
   If you re-run the program the second time, the program will print /Hello, Cumulocity!/ and exit immediately. This is because the program has loaded available credential from the given credential file. You can manually delete the credential file if you want the program to request a new credential.
   #+END_NOTE

** Integrate to Cumulocity

   Device integration is a little more complex. The whole process is depicted in Fig [[fig:integrate]], please refer to the [[http://cumulocity.com/guides/rest/device-integration/][device integration]] guide for detailed explanation. Steps /1/, /2/ and /3/ are specific to SmartREST protocol as SmartREST requires predefined templates, see [[http://cumulocity.com/guides/rest/smartrest/][SmartREST guide]] and [[http://cumulocity.com/guides/reference/smartrest/][SmartREST reference]] for more information. Step /4/ checks if the device is already stored in /Cumulocity/'s database and only create it when it's not found. Steps /6/ and /7/ get the /Cumulocity/ ID of the device from /Cumulocity/'s database. Step /8/ sets the /Cumulocity/ ID as an alias for the device ID so that the device can find its /Cumulocity/ ID next time by querying with its device ID.

   Listing [[lst:02-header]] shows the required API interface[fn:1] by ~SrAgent~ when implementing your own integrate process. Basically, you need to subclass the pure virtual class ~SrIntegrate~ and realize its virtual function ~integrate~ with your particular integrate process. This is a callback function, which will be called by ~SrAgent~ when you call the ~integrate~ method of the ~SrAgent~. By convention, the function shall returned 0 for success, and a non-0 value for failure.

   Listing [[lst:02-integrate]] realizes the flow chart depicted in Fig [[fig:integrate]]. You may have noticed all requests are Comma Separated Values (CSV) since we are using SmartREST instead of REST APIs directly. The corresponding SmartREST templates can be found in Listing [[lst:02-main]]. Important thing to note is that, you must store the correct SmartREST /X-ID/ and device's /Cumulocity ID/ in the inherited member variables ~xid~ and ~id~, respectively. They will be used by ~SrAgent~ after the integrate process for initializing corresponding internal variables.

   Listing [[lst:02-main]] extends the code in Listing [[lst:01-hello]]. The only addition inside the ~main~ function is the call to ~SrAgent~'s member function ~integrate~ for integrating to /Cumulocity/ and ~loop~ for executing the agent loop[fn:2]. Above the ~main~ function is the definition of the SmartREST template version number and actual template content[fn:3].

   Please refer to Section [[#sec:start]] about how to compile and run the code. After running this example code, you should see a device named =HelloC8Y-Agent= in /All devices/ page in your /Cumulocity/ tenant, as shown in Fig [[fig:mo]].

** Send Measurement

   Now we have successfully integrated a demo device to /Cumulocity/, we can finally do something more interesting. Let's try sending CPU measurement every 10 seconds.

   As shown in Listing [[lst:03-main]][fn:5], we need to first add a new SmartREST template for CPU measurement, and also increase the SmartREST template version number. Then we subclass the pure virtual class ~SrTimerHandler~ and implement the ~()~ operator. ~CPUMEasurement~ is a functor callback, which generates bogus CPU measurements using the ~rand~ function from the standard library. It will be called by the ~SrAgent~ at defined interval of the registered ~SrTimer~ .

   In the ~main~ function, we instantiate a ~CPUMEasurement~ and register it to an ~SrTimer~ in the /constructor/. ~SrTimer~ supports millisecond resolution, so 10 seconds is 10 * 1000 milliseconds.

   The library is built upon an asynchronous model. Hence, the ~SrAgent~ class is not responsible for any networking duty, it is essentially a scheduler for all timer and message handlers. ~SrAgent.send~ merely places a message into the ~SrAgent.egress~ queue, and returns immediately after. For actually sending SmartREST requests to /Cumulocity/, we need to instantiate a ~SrReporter~ object and execute it in a separate thread.

     class CPUMeasurement: public SrTimerHandler {
     public:
             CPUMeasurement() {}
             virtual ~CPUMeasurement() {}
             virtual void operator()(SrTimer &timer, SrAgent &agent) {
                     const int cpu = rand() % 100;
                     agent.send("103," + agent.ID() + "," + to_string(cpu));
             }
     };

     {
             // ...
             CPUMeasurement cpu;
             SrTimer timer(10 * 1000, &cpu); // Instantiate a SrTimer
             agent.addTimer(timer);          // Add the timer to agent scheduler
             timer.start();                  // Activate the timer
             SrReporter reporter(server, agent.XID(), agent.auth(),
                                 agent.egress, agent.ingress);
             if (reporter.start() != 0)      // Start the reporter thread
                     return 0;
             agent.loop();
             return 0;
     }

   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_NOTE
   If you add a ~SrTimer~ to the ~SrAgent~, you must ensure its existence throughout the program lifetime[fn:7], since there is no way to remove a ~SrTimer~ from the ~SrAgent~. Instead, you can use ~SrTimer.connect~ to register a different callback or deactivate it by ~SrTimer.stop~. This is a design choice for encouraging timer reuse, instead of dynamically creating and destroying timers.
   #+END_NOTE

** Handle Operation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sec:op
   :END:

   Besides sending requests, e.g., measurements to /Cumulocity/, the other important functionality is handle messages, either responses from /GET/ queries or real-time operations from /Cumulocity/. Listing [[lst:04-main]] demonstrates how to handle the /c8y_Restart/ operation. Again, first we will need to register necessary SmartREST templates. Then we define a message handler for handling restart operation.

   In the ~main~ function, we register the ~RestartHandler~ for SmartREST template $502$, which is the template for the restart operation. We also need to instantiate a ~SrDevicePush~ object and starting execute device push in another thread. From now on, as soon as you execute an operation from your /Cumulocity/ portal, device push will receive the operation immediately and your message handler will be invoked by the ~SrAgent~.

   #+CAPTION: Handle relay operation

     // ...

     class RestartHandler: public SrMsgHandler {
     public:
             RestartHandler() {}
             virtual ~RestartHandler() {}
             virtual void operator()(SrRecord &r, SrAgent &agent) {
                     agent.send("105," + r.value(2) + ",EXECUTING");
                     for (int i = 0; i < r.size(); ++i)
                             cerr << r.value(i) << " ";
                     cerr << endl;
                     agent.send("105," + r.value(2) + ",SUCCESSFUL");
             }
     };

     int main()
     {
             // ...
             // Inform Cumulocity about supported operations
             agent.send("104," + agent.ID() + ",\"\"\"c8y_Restart\"\"\"");
             RestartHandler restartHandler;
             agent.addMsgHandler(502, &restartHandler);
             SrDevicePush push(server, agent.XID(), agent.auth(),
                               agent.ID(), agent.ingress);
             if (push.start() != 0)      // Start the device push thread
                     return 0;
             agent.loop();
             return 0;
     }
   #+END_SRC

   Now run the program, then go to your /Cumulocity/ tenant, execute an restart operation as shown in Fig [[fig:restart]]. You should see the message printed in ~cerr~ and the operation is set to /SUCCESSFUL/ in your control tab in /Cumulocity/.

** Store SmartREST Templates in a File

   Over time, your template collection would grow large, and you would like to store them in a text file instead of hard coding them in your source code. The benefits are tow-fold: you don't need to recompile the code every time only because the templates change, and there is no need to escape special characters which is error-prone.

   A utility function ~readSrTemplate~ is provided for reading template collection from a text file. Listing [[lst:05-main]] shows the usage of this function. It reads file /srtemplate.txt/ from the current directory and stores the version number and template content into arguments ~srversion~ and ~srtemplate~, respectively.

   #+CAPTION: Read SmartREST template from a text file.
   #+NAME: lst:05-main
   #+BEGIN_SRC C++ :exports code -r
     // ex-05-template: src/main.cc
     #include <srutils.h>
     // ...

     int main()
     {
             // ...
             string srversion, srtemplate;
             if (readSrTemplate("srtemplate.txt", srverision, srtemplate) != 0)
                     return 0;
             // ...
     }
   #+END_SRC

   The file format required by ~readSrTemplate~ is as simple as following:

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [noitemsep]
   - First line contains only the template version number.
   - Every template must be on one line of its own.
   - A line starts with =#= as first character (with no leading spaces or tabs) is considered a comment line and will be ignored.
   - A complete empty line (with no spaces and tabs) will be ignored.
   - No trailing spaces or tabs are allowed for any line except comment lines.

   See listing [[lst:05-srtemplate]] for an example of template file.

** Lua Plugin

   Instead of using =c++= for your development, the library also supports rapid development in =Lua=. For =Lua= plugin support, you must build the library with explicitly enabling =Lua= support, as it's disabled by default, see Chapter [[#ch:custom]] about how to enable =Lua= plugin support.

   Listing [[lst:06-lua]] shows how to send CPU measurements and handle operation in =Lua= instead of =c++=. All =Lua= plugins are managed by ~SrLuaPluginManager~, it is exposed to all =Lua= plugins as an opaque object named /c8y/. The only requirement for a =Lua= plugin is having a ~init~ function, which will be called by ~SrLuaPluginManager~ at load time to initialize the =Lua= plugin[fn:6].

   The example also shows how to define your own =Lua= library and share its variable ~myString~ in your =Lua= plugins.

   #+BEGIN_NOTE
   You may encounter an error saying "Package lua was not found in the pkg-config search path." when building this example, then you would need to modify the expression ~$(shell pkg-config --cflags lua)~ to add a proper version number to ~lua~. The proper version number depends on your installed Lua version and your Linux distribution.

** Use MQTT instead of HTTP
   MQTT is a publish and subscribe based light-weight messaging protocol, renders it very suitable for IoT communication. It solves two major issues inherit to HTTP: 1) HTTP header predominantly overweights SmartREST payload since SmartREST messages are generally very short. 2) MQTT has built-in support for real-time notification via subscribe and publish mechanism, hence, there is no need for a separate connection for device push.

   Above examples are all using HTTP as the transportation layer. Besides HTTP, ~SrReporter~ also supports MQTT as the transportation layer. Listing [[lst:07-main]] shows the modification needed for transforming the example in Section [[#sec:op]] from using HTTP into using MQTT.

   #+CAPTION: Use MQTT for sending measurements and handle operations.
   #+NAME: lst:07-main
   #+BEGIN_SRC C++ :tangle ../examples/ex-07-mqtt-legacy/main.cc :exports code -r
     // ex-07-mqtt-legacy: src/main.cc

     int main()
     {
             // ...
             SrReporter reporter(string(server) + ":1883", deviceID, agent.XID(),
                                 agent.tenant() + '/' + agent.username(),
                                 agent.password(), agent.egress, agent.ingress);
             // set MQTT keep-alive interval to 180 seconds.
             reporter.mqttSetOpt(SR_MQTTOPT_KEEPALIVE, 180);
             if (reporter.start() != 0)      // Start the reporter thread
                     return 0;
             agent.loop();
             return 0;
     }
   #+END_SRC

   As you can see, all modification needed is to construct ~SrReporter~ with a different constructor so ~SrReporter~ knows to use MQTT as underlying communication protocol, and remove ~SrDevicePush~ in the code since MQTT has built-in support for real-time notification. Optionally, you can set the keep-alive interval for MQTT to prevent the underlying TCP connection from being interrupted.

[fn:1] The API reference is located in relative path ~doc/html/index.html~ in the library repository.

[fn:2] The agent loop is an infinite loop, so it will never really returns. We will get back to this function later.

[fn:3] Consult the [[http://cumulocity.com/guides/reference/smartrest/][SmartREST reference]] about how to define SmartREST templates.

[fn:4] All examples can be found in the ~examples~ folder in the repository.

[fn:5] The code excerpt only includes the added part, check the /examples/ folder for the complete example code.

[fn:6] Check =Lua= API reference in ~doc/lua.html~ for a complete list of all available APIs.

[fn:7] This is especially important when you dynamically allocate a timer on the heap, you must not destroy it during the program is running.
